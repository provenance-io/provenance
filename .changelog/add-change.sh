add-change.sh - Add an entry to the unreleased changelog.

Usage: add-change.sh [<num>] [<id>] [<section>] [<message>]

Each argument can alternatively be provided using flags:
    [-n|--issue|--issue-no|-p|--pr|--pull-request] <num>
    [-i|--id] <id>
    [-s|--section] <section>
    [-m|--message] <message>

[<num>] is the issue or pr number.
    This can only contain digits.
    If one is provided (without a flag), it is treated as a PR number.
    If the current branch name has the format .*/<num>-<id>, this arg can be omitted.
    If the <num> comes from the branch name, it is treated as an issue number.
[<id>] is the filename id to use for this entry.
    This can only have alpha-numeric characters, and dashes.
    If not provided, it will be extracted from the current branch name.
    The branch name can be one of .*/<digits>-<id> or .*/<id> or just <id>.
[<section>] is the section directory name that the entry will go in.
    If not provided, you'll be prompted to select it using fzf.
    If one isn't selected (or fzf isn't available), an error is printed.
    This argument can also be a partial match for a valid section as long as it
    matches only a single valid section value. I.e. you can provide this as "bug"
    and it'll automatically use "bug-fixes". But if it's "dep" it'd match either
    "deprecated" or "dependencies", so you'd be prompted using fzf.
[<message>] is the text to include in the changelog.
    If provided, it MUST have at least one space in it.
    If not provided, and the <section> is "dependencies", the get-dep-changes.sh
    script is used to generate the <message>. If not provided, and the <section>
    is anything else, the new entry will be created with a TODO note in it.
    The link will be added to the <message> automatically.
    Multiple <message>s can be provided to create multiple bullet-points in the
    new entry file.

Differentiation between <id> and <section> (when provided without flags):
    Any un-flagged args that neither have spaces nor are all digits are either
    the <id> and/or <section>. It is an error if there are more than three
    of them provided.

    If two such args are provided, then the order is determined by checking
    each for valid section matches. If the 2nd one is a valid section match (or
    neither are), the order is <id> <section>. Otherwise, it's <section> <id>.
    It is an error if there are two of these but either the <id> or <section>
    is provided using flags.

    If one such arg is provided, it is used to fill in what was not provided.
    I.e. if an <id> is provided using flags, it is the <section>. If a <section>
    is provided using flags, it is the <id>. If neither are provided using
    flags, it is the <section> only if it is a valid section match, otherwise it
    is the <id>. It is an error if there is one of these, but both the
    <id> and <section> were provided using flags.
