Provenance Blockchain version `v1.20.2` patches a vulnerability that might cause a node to crash. Validators should switch to this version at their earliest convenience.

This version fixes a [security vulnerability](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-7225-m954-23v7) in the `cosmossdk.io/math` library.

Building or installing `provenanced` from source now requires you to use [Go 1.23](https://golang.org/dl/).
