Building or installing `provenanced` from source now requires you to use [Go 1.23](https://golang.org/dl/).
Linting now requires `golangci-lint` v1.60.2. You can update yours using `make golangci-lint-update` or install it using `make golangci-lint`.

Version `v1.20.0-rc4` is state-compatible with `v1.20.0-rc3` and `v1.20.0-rc2` and it is recommended that nodes update at their earliest convenience.
