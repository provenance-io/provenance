* Enhanced `GetAccountCommitments` to support querying NFT coin commitments with optional denom filter in the exchange module [#2252](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/issues/2252).
* The `GetAccountCommitments` query now lets you filter commitments by a specific denom, added optional denom parameter.
* The CLI command `provenanced query exchange account-commitments --account <address> --denom <nhash> `now can includes an optional --denom flag, allowing users to conveniently filter commitments by denom directly from the command line.
