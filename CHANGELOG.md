<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry should ideally include a tag and
the Github issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Client Breaking" for breaking CLI commands and REST routes used by end-users.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given same genesisState and txList.

### API Breaking

* Change `Add...` metadata tx endpoints to `Write...` (e.g. `AddScope` is now `WriteScope`). [#169](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/issues/169)
* Expand and simplify metadata querying. [#169](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/issues/169)
  * Removed the `SessionContextByID` and `SessionContextByUUID` endponts. Replaced with the `Sessions` endpoint.
  * Removed the `RecordsByScopeID` and `RecordsByScopeUUID` endpoints. Replaced with the `Records` endpoint.
  * Removed the `ContractSpecificationExtended` endpoint. Use `ContractSpecification` now with the `include_record_specs` flag.
  * Removed the `RecordSpecificationByID` endpoint. Use the `RecordSpecification` endpoint.
  * Change the `_uuid` fields in the queries to `_id` to allow for either address or uuid input.
  * The `Scope` query no longer returns `Sessions` and `Records` by default. Use the `include_sessions` and `include_records` if you want them.
  * Query result entries are now wrapped to include extra id information alongside an entry.
    E.g. Where a `Scope` used to be returned, now a `ScopeWrapper` is returned containing a `Scope` and its `ScopeIdInfo`.
    So where you previously had `resp.Scope` you will now want `resp.Scope.Scope`.
  * Pluralized both the message name and field name of locator queries that return multiple entries.
    * `OSLocatorByScopeUUIDRequest` and `OSLocatorByScopeUUIDResponse` changed to `OSLocatorsByScopeUUIDRequest` and `OSLocatorsByScopeUUIDResponse`.
    * `OSLocatorByURIRequest` and `OSLocatorByURIResponse` changed to `OSLocatorsByURIRequest` and `OSLocatorsByURIResponse`.
    * Field name `locator` changed to `locators` in `OSLocatorsByURIResponse`, `OSLocatorsByScopeUUIDResponse`, `OSAllLocatorsResponse`.

### Client Breaking

* The paths for querying metadata have changed. See API Breaking section for an overview, and the proto file for details. [#169](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/issues/169)
* The CLI has been updated for metadata querying. [#169](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/issues/169)
  * Removed the `fullscope` command. Use `query metadata scope --include-sessions --include-records` now.
  * Combined the `locator-by-addr`, `locator-by-uri`, `locator-by-scope`, and `locator-all` into a single `locator` command.
* Changed the CLI metadata tx `add-...` commands to `write-...`. [#166](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/issues/166)

This is the intial beta release for the first Provenance public TESTNET.  This release is not intended for any type of
production or reliable development as extensive work is still in progress to migrate the private network functionality
into the public network.
### Features

into new 0.40.x base.  Minimal unit test coverage and features in place to begin setup of testnet process.

## PRE-HISTORY

## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/releases/tag/v0.1.0) - 2021-01-26

* Test tag prior to initial testnet release.

The Provenance Blockchain was started by Figure Technologies in 2018 using a Hyperledger Fabric derived private network.
A subsequent migration was made to a new internal private network based on the 0.38-0.39 series of Cosmos SDK and
Tendermint.  The Provence-IO/Provenance Cosmos SDK derived public network is the
