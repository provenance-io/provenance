# Provenance Blockchain Proto Files

All the Provenance Blochchain files are defined in here. This folder is synced with `buf.build/provenance-io/provenance` with each new Provenance Blockchain release by running `buf push` in this folder.

Client facing documentation must be placed in `buf.md` following the guidelines in [https://docs.buf.build/bsr/documentation](https://docs.buf.build/bsr/documentation)
