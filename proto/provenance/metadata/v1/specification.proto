// Specifications are a heirarchy of references to existing on chain data as well as a list of requirements that
// incoming requests to record data against a scope must meet.  Typical requirements included hashes that must be
// supplied corosponding to process/executable that must be ran, required signatures and sources of accounts that
// must sign requests, and allowed attributes/records that may be added to a scope.
//
// Scope Specifications
// The top level specification for a scope indicates a set of allowed GroupSpecifications (contract specs) that
// are allowed to be used against a given scope to perform updates.  Requests to record data that do not derive
// from these groupspecifications are not allowed.
//
// Group Specifications
// The primary function of group specifications is to denote the Contracts/Processes that will be used to manage
// the data within a scope.  These specifications control what information may be recorded on chain.  The use of
// definitions for inputs can build a chain of data references that must be in place in order for records to be
// added to the chain.
//
// Record Specifications
// The specifics of which records are allowed within a group (and by extension the scope overall) are outlined using
// Consideration_Specs.  These considerations include required inputs, output format, and parties that must be
// associated with any request to record.
//
// Example:
//   A GroupSpecification may list an input_spec that requires a Definition of type "fact" (indicating a reference
//   to a scope/record must exist on chain) in order for a specific Consideration (process/method) to be executed and
//   have an output_spec ultimately result in a record added to the scope.
