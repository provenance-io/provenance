## [v1.14.0](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/releases/tag/v1.14.0) - 2023-02-23

The Provenance Blockchain `v1.14.0` release includes several new features, improvements and bug fixes.
Noteably, support is added for state listing using plugins.
Also, new limitations are put in place preventing the concentration of voting power.
The `x/quarantine` and `x/sanction` modules have been added too.

The `paua` upgrade will increase all validators' max commission to 100% and max change in commission to 5% (if currently less than that).
