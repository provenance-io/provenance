## [v1.16.0](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/releases/tag/v1.16.0) - 2023-06-23

Notice: When building this version of `provenanced`, you **MUST** use go v1.20.

Version `1.16.0` of the Provenance Blockchain brings several features, improvements, and bug fixes.

A new `provenanced pre-upgrade` command has been added. Cosmovisor will automatically run it during the upgrade process. If you do not use Cosmovisor, you should manually run it before restarting your node; make sure to provide the appropriate `--home` for your environment.

### Bug Fixes

* Bring back some proto messages that were deleted but still needed for historical queries [#1554](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/issues/1554).

### API Breaking

* Add marker deposit access check for sends to marker escrow account.  Will break any current address that is sending to the
  marker escrow account if it does not have deposit access.  In order for it to work, deposit access needs to be added.  This can be done using the `MsgAddAccessRequest` tx  [#1525](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/issues/1525).
* `MsgMultiSend` is now limited to a single `Input` [PR 1506](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/pull/1506).
* SDK errors returned from Metadata module endpoints [#978](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/issues/978).
