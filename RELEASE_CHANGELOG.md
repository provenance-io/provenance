## [v1.11.1-rc2](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/releases/tag/v1.11.1-rc2) - 2022-06-22

### Bug Fixes

* Add new `msgfees` `NhashPerUsdMil`  default param to param space store on upgrade (PR [#875](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/issues/875))
* Add `mango-rc2` upgrade handler to do a couple migration pieces that were missed in v1.11.1-rc1, but needed [PR 888](https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/pull/888).
