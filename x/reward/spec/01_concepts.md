## Reward Program
Reward Programs are configurable campaigns that encourage users to participate in the Provenance Blockchain. Entities interested in creating a Reward Program will supply their new program with funds, set the duration of their program, and provide the participation requirements. 

## Qualifying Actions and Eligibility Criteria
A `Qualifying Action` is one or more transactions that a user performs on the Provenance Blockchain that has been listed within the `Reward Program`. These actions are then evaluated against a set of criteria that are also defined within the `Reward Program` known as `Eligiblity Criteria`. Users become participants in the Reward Program by performing a `Qualifying Action` and meeting all conditions specified by its `Eligiblity Criteria`.

## Claim Period
A `Reward Program` is split into one or more time intervals known as `Claim Periods`. Each of these `Claim Periods` gets an equal portion of their `Reward Program's` total funds. Users that participate within these `Claim Periods` will be eligible to obtain a reward once the `Claim Period` they participated in ends.

** Claim Period Reward**
Claim Period Reward Pool \times \left Participants Shares \over Claim Period Shares \right

## Reward Claim
When a user participates in a `Reward Program` they are granted one or more shares of the `Claim Period's` reward pool. Once the`Claim Period` ends, the participant will be able to claim their reward by performing a claim transaction. The participant's reward is calculated with the following formula: `Claim Period's reward pool` * `number of shares in the claim period` / `sum of all shares in the reward program's claim period`. 
Users are gated
