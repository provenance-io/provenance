# `x/rewards`

## Overview

The purpose of the rewards module, also known as 'Active Participation and Engagement (APE) module', is to engage and reward users for Provenance Blockchain activity. The Provenance Blockchain Foundation, or any other interested party, can create and customize their own campaigns known as Reward Programs. Provenance Blockchain users can then participate in these programs by performing the actions defined on the Reward Program. Participants will be granted shares for each qualifying action and can claim them for the respective Reward Program's reward.
