## Params

The flatfees module params can be looked up using the `Params` query.

## AllMsgFees

To get info on all msg types that have a customized flat fee, use the `AllMsgFees` query.
If a Msg type is not returned by this query, it uses the default cost.

By default, the amounts are converted to the fee denom (using the params conversion factor).
To skip this conversion (and get the costs as they are defined) set `do_not_convert` to `true`.

## MsgFee

To get the cost of a specific msg type, use the `MsgFee` query.
If there isn't a specific entry for the provided Msg type URL, the default cost is returned.

By default, the amount is converted to the fee denom (using the params conversion factor).
To skip this conversion (and get the cost as it is defined) set `do_not_convert` to `true`.

## CalculateTxFees

The `CalculateTxFees` is a replacement for tx simulation that returns both gas and fees needed for a Tx.

The built-in tx simulation can only report the amount of gas used, but not the fee required.
Our customized version returns the amount of fee needed as the gas_used so that at gas-prices of `1nhash`, gas_used * gas_prices = fee required.
But that means it is no longer reporting the actual gas wanted.
To accommodate this, the antehandler uses a default gas amount when the fee and gas wanted are equal.
However, for some large Msgs, that default gas amount might not be enough.
And for small Msgs, we might want to use less than the default to fit more in a block.
So we need this query as a way to know both the gas and fees needed for a tx.

The `gas_adjustment` only applies to the `estimated_gas` (it does not affect the `total_fees`).
