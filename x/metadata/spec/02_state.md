## Entries

The term "entries" refers to scopes, sessions, and records.
They group and identify information.

### Scopes

A scope is a high-level grouping of information combined with some access control.

* A scope must conform to a pre-determined scope specification.
* A scope is used to group together many sessions and records.

#### Scope Keys (Metadata Addresses)

Byte Array Length: `17`

| Byte range | Description         |
|------------|---------------------|
| 0          | `0x00`              |
| 1-16       | UUID of this scope. |

* Field Name: `Scope.scope_id`
* Bech32 HRP: `"scope"`
* Bech32 Example: `"scope1qzge0zaztu65tx5x5llv5xc9ztsqxlkwel"`

#### Scope Values
<!-- link message: Scope -->

+++ https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/blob/v1.19.0/proto/provenance/metadata/v1/scope.proto#L70-L102

```protobuf
// Scope defines a root reference for a collection of records owned by one or more parties.
message Scope {
  option (gogoproto.goproto_stringer) = false;

  // Unique ID for this scope.  Implements sdk.Address interface for use where addresses are required in Cosmos
  bytes scope_id = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false, (gogoproto.customtype) = "MetadataAddress"];
  // the scope specification that contains the specifications for data elements allowed within this scope
  bytes specification_id = 2 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false, (gogoproto.customtype) = "MetadataAddress"];
  // These parties represent top level owners of the records within.  These parties must sign any requests that modify
  // the data within the scope.  These addresses are in union with parties listed on the sessions.
  repeated Party owners = 3 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  // Addresses in this list are authorized to receive off-chain data associated with this scope.
  repeated string data_access = 4;
  // The address that controls the value associated with this scope.
  //
  // The value owner is actually tracked by the bank module using a coin with the denom "nft/<scope_id>".
  // The value owner can be changed using WriteScope or anything that transfers funds, e.g. MsgSend.
  //
  // During WriteScope:
  //  - If this field is empty, it indicates that there should not be a change to the value owner.
  //    I.e. Once a scope has a value owner, it will always have one (until it's deleted).
  //  - If this field has a value, the existing value owner will be looked up, and
  //    - If there's already an existing value owner, they must be a signer,
  //      and the coin will be transferred to the new value owner.
  //    - If there isn't yet a value owner, the coin will be minted and sent to the new value owner.
  //      If the scope already exists, the owners must be signers (just like changing other fields).
  //      If it's a new scope, there's no special signer limitations related to the value owner.
  string value_owner_address = 5;
  // Whether all parties in this scope and its sessions must be present in this scope's owners field.
  // This also enables use of optional=true scope owners and session parties.
  bool require_party_rollup = 6;
}
```

Before a scope is stored in state, the `value_owner_address` is cleared out (set to an empty string).
The scope is then protobuf encoded, and those bytes are the value stored in state.

#### Scope Value Owners

The `value_owner_address` is tracked using the `x/bank` module. When a scope first gets a value owner (either upon scope
creation, or later with an update), a single coin with the denom `nft/<scope_id>` is minted and placed in the value
owner's account. That coin can be transferred or traded the same ways as any other on-chain funds, e.g. via `MsgSend`.

#### Scope Indexes

Scopes by owner:
* Type byte: `0x17`
* Part 1: The owner address (length byte then value bytes)
* Part 2: All bytes of the scope key

<!-- This index also appears in the section for scope specification indexes. They must stay the same. -->
Scopes by Scope Specification:
* Type byte: `0x11`
* Part 1: All bytes of the scope specification key
* Part 2: All bytes of the scope key



### Sessions

A session is a grouping of records and the parties in charge of those records.

* A session must conform to a pre-determined contract specification.
* A session groups together a collection of records.
* A session is part of exactly one scope.

#### Session Keys (Metadata Addresses)

Byte Array Length: `33`

| Byte range | Description                                    |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0          | `0x01`                                         |
| 1-16       | UUID of the scope that this session is part of |
| 17-32      | UUID of this session                           |

* Field Name: `Session.session_id`
* Bech32 HRP: `"session"`
* Bech32 Example: `"session1qxge0zaztu65tx5x5llv5xc9zts9sqlch3sxwn44j50jzgt8rshvqyfrjcr"`

#### Session Values
<!-- link message: Session -->

+++ https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/blob/v1.19.0/proto/provenance/metadata/v1/scope.proto#L104-L123

```protobuf
// Session defines an execution context against a specific specification instance.
// The context will have a specification and set of parties involved.
//
// NOTE: When there are no more Records within a Scope that reference a Session, the Session is removed.
message Session {
  option (gogoproto.goproto_stringer) = false;

  bytes session_id = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false, (gogoproto.customtype) = "MetadataAddress"];
  // unique id of the contract specification that was used to create this session.
  bytes specification_id = 2 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false, (gogoproto.customtype) = "MetadataAddress"];
  // parties is the set of identities that signed this contract
  repeated Party parties = 3 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  // name to associate with this session execution context, typically classname
  string name = 4;
  // context is a field for storing client specific data associated with a session.
  bytes context = 5;
  // Created by, updated by, timestamps, version number, and related info.
  AuditFields audit = 99;
}
```

#### Session Indexes

There are no extra indexes involving sessions.
Note, though, that the session key is constructed in a way that automatically indexes sessions by scope.



### Records

A record identifies the inputs and outputs of a process.
It is conceptually similar to the values involved in a method call.

* A record must conform to a pre-determined record specification.
* A record is part of exactly one scope.
* A record is part of exactly one session.

#### Record Keys (Metadata Addresses)

Byte Array Length: `33`

| Byte range | Description                                                 |

#### Record Values
<!-- link message: Record -->

+++ https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/blob/v1.19.0/proto/provenance/metadata/v1/scope.proto#L125-L142

```protobuf
// A record (of fact) is attached to a session or each consideration output from a contract
message Record {
  option (gogoproto.goproto_stringer) = false;

  // name/identifier for this record.  Value must be unique within the scope.  Also known as a Fact name
  string name = 1;
  // id of the session context that was used to create this record (use with filtered kvprefix iterator)
  bytes session_id = 2 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false, (gogoproto.customtype) = "MetadataAddress"];
  // process contain information used to uniquely identify an execution on or off chain that generated this record
  Process process = 3 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  // inputs used with the process to achieve the output on this record
  repeated RecordInput inputs = 4 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  // output(s) is the results of executing the process on the given process indicated in this record
  repeated RecordOutput outputs = 5 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  // specification_id is the id of the record specification that was used to create this record.
  bytes specification_id = 6 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false, (gogoproto.customtype) = "MetadataAddress"];
}
```

#### Record Indexes

There are no extra indexes involving records.
Note, though, that the record key is constructed in a way that automatically indexes records by scope.



## Specifications

The term "specifications" refers to scope specifications, contract specifications, and record specifications.
They define validation parameters for the various entries.
Ideally, specifications will be used for multiple entries.

### Scope Specifications

A scope specification defines validation parameters for scopes.
They group together contract specifications and define roles that must be involved in a scope.

#### Scope Specification Keys (Metadata Addresses)

Byte Array Length: `17`

| Byte range | Description                      |

| 1-16       | UUID of this scope specification |

* Field Name: `ScopeSpecification.specification_id`
* Bech32 HRP: `"scopespec"`
* Bech32 Example: `"scopespec1qnwg86nsatx5pl56muw0v9ytlz3qu3jx6m"`

#### Scope Specification Values
