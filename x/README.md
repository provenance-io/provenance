# List of Modules

Modules are the code components of the Provenance Blockchain that execute the majority of the business logic for applications. The [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47) enables developers to build modules that utilize the core structure of the SDK to allow the modules to function together. To read more about creating modules, refer to the [Cosmos documentation on modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/building-modules/intro).

Provenance uses inherited modules from the Cosmos SDK, and has also developed modules that are specific to Provenance.
