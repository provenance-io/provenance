## User Endpoints

There are several endpoints available for all users, but some markets might have restrictions on their use.


### CreateAsk

An ask order indicates the desire to sell some `assets` at a minimum `price`.
They are created using the `CreateAsk` endpoint.

Markets can define a set of attributes that an account must have in order to create ask orders in them.
So, this endpoint might not be available, depending on the `seller` and the `market_id`.
Markets can also disable order creation altogether, making this endpoint unavailable for that `market_id`.

It is expected to fail if:
* The `market_id` does not exist.
* The market is not allowing orders to be created.
* The market requires attributes in order to create ask orders and the `seller` is missing one or more.
* The `assets` are not in the `seller`'s account.
* The `price` is in a denom not supported by the market.
* The `seller_settlement_flat_fee` is in a denom different from the `price`, and is not in the `seller`'s account.
* The `seller_settlement_flat_fee` is insufficient (as dictated by the market).
* The `external_id` value is not empty and is already in use in the market.
* The `order_creation_fee` is not in the `seller`'s account.

### CreateBid

A bid order indicates the desire to buy some `assets` at a specific `price`.
They are created using the `CreateBid` endpoint.

Markets can define a set of attributes that an account must have in order to create bid orders in them.
So, this endpoint might not be available, depending on the `buyer` and the `market_id`.
Markets can also disable order creation altogether, making this endpoint unavailable for that `market_id`.

It is expected to fail if:
* The `market_id` does not exist.
* The market is not allowing orders to be created.
* The market requires attributes in order to create bid orders and the `buyer` is missing one or more.
* The `price` funds are not in the `buyer`'s account.
* The `price` is in a denom not supported by the market.
* The `buyer_settlement_fees` are not in the `buyer`'s account.
* The `buyer_settlement_fees` are insufficient (as dictated by the market).
* The `external_id` value is not empty and is already in use in the market.
* The `order_creation_fee` is not in the `buyer`'s account.

### CommitFunds

Funds can be committed to a market using the `CommitFunds` endpoint.
If the account already has funds committed to the market, the provided funds are added to that commitment amount.

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The market is not accepting commitments.
* The market requires attributes in order to create commitments and the `account` is missing one or more.
* The `creation_fee` is insufficient (as dictated by the market).
* The `amount` is not spendable in the account (after paying the creation fee).

#### MsgCommitFundsResponse

+++ https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/blob/v1.19.0/proto/provenance/exchange/v1/tx.proto#L178-L179


### CancelOrder

Orders can be cancelled using the `CancelOrder` endpoint.
When an order is cancelled, the hold on its funds is released and the order is deleted.

Users can cancel their own orders at any time.
Market actors with the `PERMISSION_CANCEL` permission can also cancel orders in that market at any time.

Order creation fees are **not** refunded when an order is cancelled.

It is expected to fail if:
* The order does not exist.
* The `signer` is not one of:
  * The order's owner (e.g. `buyer` or `seller`).
  * An account with `PERMISSION_CANCEL` in the order's market.
  * The governance module account (`authority`).

### FillBids

If a market allows user-settlement, users can use the `FillBids` endpoint to settle one or more bids with their own `assets`.
This is similar to an "Immediate or cancel" `AskOrder` with the sum of the provided bids' assets and prices.
Fees are paid the same as if an `AskOrder` were actually created and settled normally with the provided bids.
The `seller` must be allowed to create an `AskOrder` in the given market.

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The market is not allowing orders to be created.
* The market does not allow user-settlement.
* The market requires attributes in order to create ask orders and the `seller` is missing one or more.
* One or more `bid_order_ids` are not bid orders (or do not exist).
* One or more `bid_order_ids` are in a market other than the provided `market_id`.
* The `total_assets` are not in the `seller`'s account.
* The sum of bid order `assets` does not equal the provided `total_assets`.
* The `seller` or one of the `buyer`s are sanctioned, or are not allowed to possess the funds they are to receive.
* The `seller_settlement_flat_fee` is insufficient.
* The `seller_settlement_flat_fee` is not in the `seller`'s account (after `assets` and `price` funds have been transferred).
* The `ask_order_creation_fee` is insufficient.
* The `ask_order_creation_fee` is not in the `seller`'s account (after all other transfers have been made).

### FillAsks

If a market allows user-settlement, users can use the `FillAsks` endpoint to settle one or more asks with their own price funds.
This is similar to an "Immediate or cancel" `BidOrder` with the sum of the provided asks' assets and prices.
Fees are paid the same as if a `BidOrder` were actually created and settled normally with the provided asks.
The `buyer` must be allowed to create a `BidOrder` in the given market.

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The market is not allowing orders to be created.
* The market does not allow user-settlement.
* The market requires attributes in order to create bid orders and the `buyer` is missing one or more.
* One or more `ask_order_ids` are not ask orders (or do not exist).
* One or more `ask_order_ids` are in a market other than the provided `market_id`.
* The `total_price` funds are not in the `buyer`'s account.
* The sum of ask order `price`s does not equal the provided `total_price`.
* The `buyer` or one of the `seller`s are sanctioned, or are not allowed to possess the funds they are to receive.
* The `buyer_settlement_fees` are insufficient.
* The `buyer_settlement_fees` are not in the `buyer`'s account (after `assets` and `price` funds have been transferred).
* The `bid_order_creation_fee` is insufficient.
* The `bid_order_creation_fee` is not in the `buyer`'s account (after all other transfers have been made).

## Market Endpoints

Several endpoints are only available to accounts designated by the market.
These are all also available for use in governance proposals using the governance module account (aka `authority`) as the `admin`.


### MarketSettle

Orders are settled using the `MarketSettle` endpoint.
The `admin` must have the `PERMISSION_SETTLE` permission in the market (or be the `authority`).

The market is responsible for identifying order matches.
Once identified, this endpoint is used to settle and clear the matched orders.

All orders in a settlement must have the same asset denom and the same price denom.

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The `admin` does not have `PERMISSION_SETTLE` in the market, and is not the `authority`.
* One or more `ask_order_ids` are not ask orders, or do not exist, or are in a market other than the provided `market_id`.
* One or more `bid_order_ids` are not bid orders, or do not exist, or are in a market other than the provided `market_id`.
* There is more than one denom in the `assets` of all the provided orders.
* There is more than one denom in the `price` of all the provided orders.
* The market requires a seller settlement ratio fee, but there is no ratio defined for the `price` denom.
* Two or more orders are being partially filled.
* One or more orders cannot be filled at all with the `assets` or `price` funds available in the settlement.
* An order is being partially filled, but `expect_partial` is `false`.
* All orders are being filled in full, but `expect_partial` is `true`.
* One or more of the `buyer`s and `seller`s are sanctioned, or are not allowed to possess the funds they are to receive.

### MarketCommitmentSettle

A market can move committed funds using the `MarketCommitmentSettle` endpoint.
The `admin` must have the `PERMISSION_SETTLE` permission in the market (or be the `authority`).

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The `admin` does not have `PERMISSION_SETTLE` in the market, and is not the `authority`.
* The sum of the `inputs` does not equal the sum of the `outputs`.
* Not enough funds have been committed by one or more accounts to the market.
* A NAV is needed (for fee calculation) that does not exist and was not provided.

+++ https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/blob/v1.19.0/proto/provenance/exchange/v1/tx.proto#L299-L300


### MarketReleaseCommitments

A market can release committed funds using the `MarketReleaseCommitments` endpoint.
The `admin` must have the `PERMISSION_CANCEL` permission in the market (or be the `authority`).

Providing an empty amount indicates that all funds currently committed in that account (to the market) should be released.

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The `admin` does not have `PERMISSION_CANCEL` in the market, and is not the `authority`.
* One or more of the amounts is more than what is currently committed by the associated `account`.

+++ https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/blob/v1.19.0/proto/provenance/exchange/v1/tx.proto#L317-L318


### MarketSetOrderExternalID

Some markets might want to attach their own identifiers to orders.
This is done using the `MarketSetOrderExternalID` endpoint.
The `admin` must have the `PERMISSION_SET_IDS` permission in the market (or be the `authority`).

Orders with external ids can be looked up using the [GetOrderByExternalID](05_queries.md#getorderbyexternalid) query.

External ids must be unique in a market, but multiple markets can use the same external id.

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The `admin` does not have `PERMISSION_SET_IDS` in the market, and is not the `authority`.
* The order does not exist, or is in a different market than the provided `market_id`.
* The provided `external_id` equals the order's current `external_id`.
* The provided `external_id` is already associated with another order in the same market.

### MarketWithdraw

When fees are collected by a market, they are given to the market's account.
Those funds can then be withdrawn/transferred using the `MarketWithdraw` endpoint.
The `admin` must have the `PERMISSION_WITHDRAW` permission in the market (or be the `authority`).

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The `admin` does not have `PERMISSION_WITHDRAW` in the market, and is not the `authority`.
* The `amount` funds are not in the market's account.
* The `to_address` is not allowed to possess the requested funds.

### MarketUpdateDetails

A market's details can be updated using the `MarketUpdateDetails` endpoint.
The `admin` must have the `PERMISSION_UPDATE` permission in the market (or be the `authority`).

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The `admin` does not have `PERMISSION_UPDATE` in the market, and is not the `authority`.
* One or more of the [MarketDetails](#marketdetails) fields is too large.

+++ https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/blob/v1.19.0/proto/provenance/exchange/v1/tx.proto#L375-L376


### MarketUpdateAcceptingOrders

A market can enable or disable order creation using the `MarketUpdateAcceptingOrders` endpoint.
The `admin` must have the `PERMISSION_UPDATE` permission in the market (or be the `authority`).

With `accepting_orders` = `false`, no one can create any new orders in the market, but existing orders can still be settled or cancelled.

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The `admin` does not have `PERMISSION_UPDATE` in the market, and is not the `authority`.
* The provided `accepting_orders` value equals the market's current setting.

### MarketUpdateUserSettle

Using the `MarketUpdateUserSettle` endpoint, markets can control whether user-settlement is allowed.
The `admin` must have the `PERMISSION_UPDATE` permission in the market (or be the `authority`).

The [FillBids](#fillbids) and [FillAsks](#fillasks) endpoints are only available for markets where `allow_user_settlement` = `true`.
The [MarketSettle](#marketsettle) endpoint is usable regardless of this setting.

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The `admin` does not have `PERMISSION_UPDATE` in the market, and is not the `authority`.
* The provided `allow_user_settlement` value equals the market's current setting.

### MarketUpdateAcceptingCommitments

Using the `MarketUpdateAcceptingCommitments` endpoint, a market can control whether it is accepting commitments.
The `admin` must have the `PERMISSION_UPDATE` permission in the market (or be the `authority`).

The [CommitFunds](#CommitFunds) endpoint is only available for markets where `accepting_orders` = `true`.

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The `admin` does not have `PERMISSION_UPDATE` in the market, and is not the `authority`.
* The provided `accepting_orders` value equals the market's current setting.
* The provided `accepting_orders` is `true` but no commitment-related fees are defined.
* The provided `accepting_orders` is `true` and bips are set, but either no intermediary denom is defined or there is no NAV associating the intermediary denom with the chain's fee denom.

### MarketUpdateIntermediaryDenom

The `MarketUpdateIntermediaryDenom` endpoint allows a market to change its intermediary denom (used for commitment settlement fee calculation).
The `admin` must have the `PERMISSION_UPDATE` permission in the market (or be the `authority`).

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The `admin` does not have `PERMISSION_UPDATE` in the market, and is not the `authority`.
* The provided `intermediary_denom` is not a valid denom string.

### MarketManagePermissions

Permissions in a market are managed using the `MarketManagePermissions` endpoint.
The `admin` must have the `PERMISSION_PERMISSIONS` permission in the market (or be the `authority`).

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The `admin` does not have `PERMISSION_PERMISSIONS` in the market, and is not the `authority`.
* One or more `revoke_all` addresses do not currently have any permissions in the market.
* One or more `to_revoke` entries do not currently exist in the market.
* One or more `to_grant` entries already exist in the market (after `revoke_all` and `to_revoke` are processed).

### MarketManageReqAttrs

The attributes required to create orders in a market can be managed using the `MarketManageReqAttrs` endpoint.
The `admin` must have the `PERMISSION_ATTRIBUTES` permission in the market (or be the `authority`).

See also: [Required Attributes](01_concepts.md#required-attributes).

It is expected to fail if:
* The market does not exist.
* The `admin` does not have `PERMISSION_ATTRIBUTES` in the market, and is not the `authority`.
* One or more attributes to add are already required by the market (for the given order type).
* One or more attributes to remove are not currently required by the market (for the given order type).

## Payment Endpoints

There are several endpoints for using `Payment`s to facilitate transfers of funds between two accounts.
These are available to any account, and are not associated with any markets.


### CreatePayment

A `Payment` can be created using the `CreatePayment` endpoint.
The `source` is the account creating the payment. As part of payment creation, a hold is placed on the `source_amount` funds in the `source` account.

A payment is uniquely identified using a combination of its `source` and `external_id`.
The `source` is responsible for choosing the `external_id` of the payment, so it is up to them to choose one that they aren't currently using.
Once a payment is accepted, rejected, or cancelled, its `external_id` can be re-used on a new payment.

A payment can be created without a `target`, but one cannot be accepted until a target has been set for it.

A `Tx` with a `MsgCreatePaymentRequest` requires an additional amount in the fee if the `source_amount` is not zero.
That amount is defined in the exchange module [Params](06_params.md).
The [OrderFeeCalc](05_queries.md#orderfeecalc) query can be used to identify how much extra fee to include.

It is expected to fail if:
* The `source` is not a valid bech32 string.
* The `target` isn't empty and is not a valid bech32 string.
* The `source_amount` funds are not available in the `source` account.
* The `external_id` is longer than 100 characters.
* A payment already exists with the given `source` and `external_id`.

#### MsgCreatePaymentResponse

+++ https://github.com/provenance-io/provenance/blob/v1.19.0/proto/provenance/exchange/v1/tx.proto#L525-L526


### AcceptPayment

A `target` can accept a previously created `Payment` using the `AcceptPayment` endpoint.

When a payment is accepted, the hold on the `source_amount` funds is released, and they are sent to the `target`; then the `target_amount` funds are sent to the `source`. Lastly, the `Payment` record is deleted.

A `Tx` with a `MsgAcceptPaymentRequest` requires an additional amount in the fee if the `target_amount` is not zero.
That amount is defined in the exchange module [Params](06_params.md).
The [OrderFeeCalc](05_queries.md#orderfeecalc) query can be used to identify how much extra fee to include.

It is expected to fail if:
* Any part of the provided `Payment` info does not match the payment's current state.
* The `target` account does not have the `target_amount` funds in it.

### RejectPayment

A `target` can reject a `Payment` using the `RejectPayment` endpoint.

When a payment is rejected, the hold on the `source_amount` is released and the payment record is deleted.

It is expected to fail if:
* A payment does not exist with the provided `source` and `external_id`.
* The existing payment has a `target` different from the one provided (that signed the msg).

### RejectPayments

A `target` can reject all payments from one or more `source` accounts using the `RejectPayments` endpoint.

For each applicable payment, the hold on the `source_amount` funds is released, and the payment record is deleted.

It is expected to fail if:
* No `source` accounts are provided.
* One of the provided `source` accounts does not have any payments for the `target`.

### CancelPayments

A `source` can cancel their payments with one or more `external_id`s using the `CancelPayments` endpoint.

For each applicable payment, the hold on the `source_amount` funds is released, and the payment record is deleted.

It is expected to fail if:
* No `external_id`s are provided.
* The `source` does not have a payment with one of the provided external ids.

### ChangePaymentTarget

A `source` can change the `target` of a `Payment` using the `ChangePaymentTarget` endpoint.

This can be used to:
* Set a target on a payment that previously didn't have one.
* Change the target from one account to another.
* Unset the payment's target.

A payment's target can be changed multiple times (until it's accepted, rejected, or cancelled).

It is expected to fail if:
* No payment exists with the given `source` and `external_id`.
* The provided `new_target` equals the payment's current `target`.

## Governance Proposals

There are several governance-proposal-only endpoints.


### GovCreateMarket

Market creation must be done via governance proposal with a `MsgGovCreateMarketRequest`.

If the provided `market_id` is `0` (zero), the next available market id will be assigned to the new market.
If it is not zero, the provided `market_id` will be used (unless it's already in use by another market).
If it's already in use, the proposal will fail.

It is recommended that the message be checked using the [ValidateCreateMarket](05_queries.md#validatecreatemarket) query first, to reduce the risk of failure or problems.

It is expected to fail if:
* The provided `authority` is not the governance module's account.
* The provided `market_id` is not zero, and is already in use by another market.
* One or more of the [MarketDetails](#marketdetails) fields is too large.
* One or more required attributes are invalid.

### GovManageFees

A market's fees can only be altered via governance proposal with a `MsgGovManageFeesRequest`.

It is recommended that the message be checked using the [ValidateManageFees](05_queries.md#validatemanagefees) query first, to ensure the updated fees do not present any problems.

It is expected to fail if:
* The provided `authority` is not the governance module's account.

### GovCloseMarket

A market can be closed via governance proposal with a `MsgGovCloseMarketRequest`.

When a market is closed, it stops accepting orders and commitments, all orders are cancelled, and all commitments are released.

It is expected to fail if:
* The provided `authority` is not the governance module's account.

### UpdateParams

The exchange module params are updated via governance proposal with a `MsgUpdateParamsRequest`.

It is expected to fail if:
* The provided `authority` is not the governance module's account.
